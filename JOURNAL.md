# 30th May: Started Working on the PCB!

- So I started working on the PCB for the concept I have. I'm thinking cat ears with the following:
  1. The NeoPixel ARGBs
  2. When you tilt, it changes patterns!
- Schematics are SO cooked rn (#freelou) because I'm trying to combine knowlegde so this is likely NOT gonna work yet :sob:
- Here's a cute image tho :P
